# FishTracking (test DeepSort with Yolov8)

Due to issues with libraries and to computational issues on google colab, the result is not staisfactory.
Nevertheless, you can try it by opening the 'DeepSORT_pipeline.ipynb' on colab and following the instructions.

'FishDetectionAndTracking.ipynb' is the file used to train the model.
'TrainShadow' is a python file containing some work we did to try to recognize shadows using a CNNN. The goal was to implement it in our model to better distinguish shadows from fishes but we did not have the time to go through with it.
